<h1>WASTE MANAGEMENT</h1>
<h3> Waste Management refers to the range of strategies and tactics used to efficiently handle waste,
      from its creation to its disposalbe or recovery. It entails a variety of tactics and approaches to cut down on waste generation,
       lessen the impact it has on the environment, and guarantee appropriate disposal or recycling.</h3>

       <h3>Trash has been a major problem in the Manila, and as years pass by the problem grew worse.
          In 2016, a record from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority or MMDA,
           states that the total volume of garbage thrown by Metro Manila residents was 9,499.44 tons per day,
            compared with 8,600 tons per day in 2010, and the numbers could still rise in the following years (45 percent of Metro’s garbage not properly disposed, 2017a).
          Even though a large amount of waste is being collected daily it is still not enough.</h3>
